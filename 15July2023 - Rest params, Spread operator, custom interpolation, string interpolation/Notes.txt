Rest parameters:  used to store the rest parmeters passed as arguments to a function.

 function f1(a, b, ...v) {
            console.log(a, b);
            console.log(v);
        }
        f1(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);

spread operator:

<html>

<head>

</head>

<body>

    <script>
        function f1(a, b, c, d, ...restparams) {
            console.log(a);
            console.log(restparams);
        }
        var arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 5, 7, 7];
        //es5
        f1(arr[0], arr[1], arr[2], arr[3]);
        //es6
        f1(...arr);
    </script>
</body>

</html>



PS: 

Create a function with 3 params and take an array of 5 value and pass them through 
spread operator, additional values coming from spread operator should be gathered
using rest parameter.


function myFun(a,b,c,...x) {
    console.log(a,b,c);
    console.log(x)
}

arr = [10,20,30,40,50]
myFun(...arr)


String Interpolation: allows to write free style to text in multiple lines.
